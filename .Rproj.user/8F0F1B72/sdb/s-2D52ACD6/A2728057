Anyone who really wants to build machine learning models and apply them in a valuable way to real-word problems \n  can with the help of open source technology. What startml does is speed up the learning-through-doing \n  process for new comers. How this happens is by providing tools for automatically building many models, \n  helping you put some miles on your CPU doing machine learning, and hopefully, giving you a little \n  boost to some early success, inspiring more effort towards building a valuable knowledge and skill set.\nDepends: R (>= 3.1.0)\nImports: \n  h2o,\n  ggplot2,\n  reshape2,\n  plyr,\n  gridExtra,\n  plotly,\n  tsne, \n  methods, \n  htmlwidgets\nLicense: GPL 3\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\n",
