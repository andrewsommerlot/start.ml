# startml = start machine learning 
Get started on training optimization and ensembles with popular machine learning algorithms. Powered by h2o!

Why startml? Anyone who really wants to build machine learning models and apply them in a valuable way to real-word problems can with the help of open source technology. 

What startml does is speed up the learning-through-doing process for new comers.

How this happens is by providing tools for automatically building many models, helping you put some miles on your CPU doing machine learning, and hopefully, giving you a little boost to some early success, inspiring more effort towards building a valuable knowledge and skill set. If you feel any connection to the figure below, try installing startml.

Its for you if: You are excited to learn new things, focused on the fastest path to creating value, 
and probably a little impatient.
