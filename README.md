# startml = start machine learning 
Start doing machine learning with training optimization and ensembles of popular machine learning algorithms. Powered by the scalable implenentations of powerful algoriths provided by h2o. 

Why startml? Anyone who really wants to build machine learning models and apply them in a valuable way to real-word problems can with the help of open source technology. 

What startml does is speed up the learning-through-doing process for new comers.

How this happens is by providing tools for automatically building many models, helping you put some miles on your CPU doing machine learning, and hopefully, giving you a little boost to some early success, inspiring more effort towards building a valuable knowledge and skill set. 

It might be for you if: You want to do machine learning, you are excited to learn new things, you are focused on the fastest path to creating value, and you are (a little) impatient. 

# Install 
startml is an R package currently hosted here on github. 
You can install it with devtools from this repository

If you don't have devtools, then in an R instance or Rstudio:

install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools) 

Then install startml: 

install_github("andrewsommerlot/startml")

library(startml)
